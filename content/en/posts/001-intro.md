Hello! Welcome to my blog, where I plan to document the different techniques one can use to analyze malware, both statically and dynamically. 

Why do a blog related to malware analysis? Understanding the different techniques that an attacker uses to achieve their goal is something that I have been interested in for years, from simple phishing emails containing an executable to complicated Stuxnet-style software. While I've been interested in the topic for years, I haven't dedicated much time to it, so by doing this blog I plan to force myself to learn new topics, learn the different techniques attackers use to evade defenses, and share what I've learned.

The goal of the blog is to share knowledge and encourage learning; however, I am not an expert at analyzing malware (as I mentioned previously, I am in the process of learning), so if I left anything out or you have any suggestion, let me know! You can contact me at contact@threatanatomy.io.

Thanks for reading the blog!
