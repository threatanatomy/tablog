Hello! Welcome to my blog, where I plan to document the different techniques one can use to analyze malware, both statically and dynamically. 

Why do a blog related to malware analysis? Understanding the different techniques that an attacker uses to achieve their goal is something that I have been interested in for years, from simple phishing emails to complicated Stuxnet-style software.

The goal of the blog is to share knowledge and encourage learning; however, I would not consider myself an expert, so if I left anything out or you have any suggestion, let me know! You can contact me at contact@threatanatomy.io.

Thanks for reading the blog!
